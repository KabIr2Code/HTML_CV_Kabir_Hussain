Use the HTML you have learned to create a CV webpage for yourself.

Start by creating an index.html file in this folder, and construct your page in there.

Your page should have a <head> section and a <body> section. If you have installed emmet you can
use the emmet shortcut here to create your basic page scaffold (write an exclamation mark ! and press TAB)

In the head of your document you need to make sure your page has a title, and you may also wish to include a favicon.

In the body of your document make sure to use semantic HTML tags such as <header>, <main>, <footer>, etc to correctly label your content and give it semantic meaning. Try to use as wide a range of html tags as you can.

Do not worry too much about what your page looks like just now. The previous business card homework has a small amount of helper
CSS included to help with the layout which you do not have here, so you will be relying on the default CSS that browsers supply
themselves (the user agent stylesheet). Try not to use HTML tags based on how they make the page content look, but rather think
about what are the most appropriate tags to give your content the correct semantic meaning. Remember HTML is just for describing content, the styling is CSS's job.

When you are finished, deploy your work to the web using Netlify Drop

Good luck!
